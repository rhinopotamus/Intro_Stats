### Functions introduced in this module:
`cor`, `cor.test`
</div>


## Introduction

In this module we will learn how to run a correlation analysis. Correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables.


## Load packages

We load the standard `mosaic` package as well as the `reshape2` package for the `tips` data and the `OIdata` package for the `state` data. The `broom` package gives us tidy output.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(reshape2)
library(OIdata)
data(state)
library(broom)
library(mosaic)
```


## Research question

Is there is a correlation between the size of a restaurant bill and the size of the tip?


## Correlation

The word correlation describes a linear relationship between two numerical variables. As long as certain conditions are met, we can calculate a statistic called the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted R.^[In most places, the Pearson correlation coefficient is denoted by a lowercase r, but the OpenIntro book uses an uppercase R.] This value will be some number between -1 and 1. Coefficients close to zero indicate little or no correlation, coefficients close to 1 indicate strong positive correlation, and coefficients close to -1 indicate strong negative correlation. In between, we often use words like weak, moderately weak, moderate, and moderately strong. There are no exact cutoffs for when such words apply. You must learn from experience how to judge scatterplots and R values to make such determinations.

Let's examine a data set called `tips` from the `reshape2` package. Since there is also a `tips` data set in the `openintro` package, we'll use a trick to make sure we get the right one. The double colon is placed between the name of the package and the name of the data frame:

```{r}
tips <- reshape2::tips
str(tips)
```

These 244 observations were collected by one waiter over a period of a few months working in a restaurant. Our research question asks us to consider the variables `tip` and `total_bill`.

If all we wanted was the value of R, we could find it by using the `cor` command.

```{r}
R <- cor(tip ~ total_bill, data = tips)
R
```

Although the `cor` command accepts the "tilde" notation, the order doesn't matter; correlation is symmetric, so the R value is the same independent of the choice of response and explanatory variables.

This sample correlation R is an estimate of the true population correlation, called $\rho$, the Greek letter "rho". A typical null hypothesis is that there is no correlation between the two variables---in other words, $\rho = 0$. Under that assumption, the sampling distribution is somewhat complicated. Although the sample correlations don't follow a simple distribution, if we calculate

$$t = \frac{R - \rho}{\sqrt{\frac{1 - R^{2}}{n - 2}}} = \frac{R}{\sqrt{\frac{1 - R^{2}}{n - 2}}},$$

then the values of $t$ follow a Student t distribution with $n - 2$ degrees of freedom. (The last step above takes into account the fact that the null value for $\rho$ is zero.)

We can verify this with a basic simulation. First, we shuffle the values of `total_bill` to remove any association with tips to simulate the assumption of the null hypothesis. Here are a few examples:

```{r}
set.seed(11)
cor(tip ~ shuffle(total_bill), data = tips)
```

```{r}
cor(tip ~ shuffle(total_bill), data = tips)
```

```{r}
cor(tip ~ shuffle(total_bill), data = tips)
```

We use the `do` command to do this a bunch of times.

```{r}
set.seed(11)
sims <- do(2000) * cor(tip ~ shuffle(total_bill), data = tips)
sims
```

The t scores follow a Student t distribution, not the correlations themselves, so we have to calculate the t scores. We use the `mutate` command to compute the t score for each row of `sims`. The number 242 is $n - 2$.

```{r}
sims <- sims %>%
    mutate(t = cor/(sqrt((1 - cor^2)/242)))
sims
```

Now we can graph the simulated values. We superimpose the t distribution with $df = 242$ to show that it's a pretty good fit.

```{r}
# Don't worry about the syntax here.
# You won't need to know how to do this on your own.
ggplot(sims, aes(x = t)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.4) +
    stat_function(fun = "dt", args = list(df = 242),
                  color = "blue", size = 1.5)
```


## Inference for correlation

Calculating a correlation coefficient blindly can be dangerous. Without meeting certain conditions, the value of R could be incredibly misleading. R (the software) will gladly compute R (the correlation coefficient) for any data, whether appropriate or not. Therefore, we will follow our inferential rubric to decide if there is a statistically significant relationship between the tip and the corresponding bill. In truth, the entire inferential rubric is probably overkill for such a simple question. Nevertheless, the rubric does ensure that we take care to identify our sample and population, establish hypotheses, check conditions, and state proper conclusions.

In addition to the standard "Random" and "10%" conditions, we introduce two new conditions. First, we need to know that the association is linear. Nonlinear relationships can exist, but the R value makes no sense for such situations. Finally, we need to check for outliers. These two conditions should be checked by looking at a scatterplot.


## Exploratory data analysis

### Use data documentation (help files, code books, Google, etc.), the `str` command, and other summary functions to understand the data.

[You should type `?tips` at the Console to read the help file.]

```{r}
tips
```

```{r}
str(tips)
```

We can also look at each numerical variable individually with `favstats`:

```{r}
favstats(tips$tip)
```

```{r}
favstats(tips$total_bill)
```

### Prepare the data for analysis. [Not always necessary.]

The two variables of interest are coded correctly as numerical variables in the `tips` data frame, so we don't need to do anything for this step.

### Make tables or plots to explore the data visually.

The appropriate plot for two numerical variables is a scatterplot. We are thinking of `tip` as the response variable and `total_bill` as the explanatory variable.

```{r}
ggplot(tips, aes(y = tip, x = total_bill)) +
    geom_point()
```

There does appear to be a moderate, positive association between these variables.

##### Exercise 1

There appears to be a pattern of unusual bunching into horizontal lines in the lower left part of the graph. Can you explain this pattern? (Hint: use `arrange` to sort the `tip` variable. We've used the `arrange` command several times in the modules before, but if you need a reminder, you can go back to the module "5. Manipulating data".)

<div class = "answer">

```{r}
# Add code here to sort the tip variable.
```

## Hypotheses

### Identify the sample (or samples) and a reasonable population (or populations) of interest.

The sample consists of `r NROW(tips)` meals a waiter served over the course of several months working at a restaurant. The population is presumably all meals this waiter might ever serve at this restaurant. (It would not make sense to include other servers or other restaurants in this population as bills and tips vary widely from person to person and restaurant to restaurant.)

### Express the null and alternative hypotheses as contextually meaningful full sentences.

$H_{0}:$ There is no correlation between the tip and the total bill.

$H_{A}:$ There is a correlation between the tip and the total bill.

### Express the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols (when possible).

$H_{0}: \rho = 0$

$H_{A}: \rho \neq 0$.

Commentary: We are performing a two-sided test here. One could perform a one-sided test if the question of interest was about a positive or a negative correlation specifically. Unless otherwise specified, though, the default is to run a two-sided test.


## Model

### Identify the sampling distribution model.

We use a t model with `r NROW(tips) - 2` degrees of freedom.

### Check the relevant conditions to ensure that model assumptions are met.

* Random
    - This is not a random sample, but over several months, it seems reasonable that this is representative of this waiter's experiences at this restaurant.

* 10%
    - Assuming the waiter works at this restaurant for several years, 244 meals is probably less than 10% of all meals he will serve.

* Linear association
    - The scatterplot shows a reasonably linear pattern.

* Outliers
    - We don't see any significant outliers in the scatterplot. There are a few dots here and there that are a little far from the main cloud, but nothing that worries us too much, especially given the large sample size.

Commentary: No data will ever line up in a perfect straight line. The "linear association" condition is meant to suggest that the "cloud of dots" should be more or less in a straight pattern moving across the plot. We are most concerned here with checking that the pattern does not curve substantially, and this does not appear to. As with any outliers, judge them based on how far away from the data cloud they are, and keep in mind that outliers tend to be more influential when sample sizes are small.


## Mechanics

### Compute the test statistic.

```{r}
tips_test <- cor.test(tip ~ total_bill, data = tips)
tips_test_tidy <- tidy(tips_test)
tips_test_tidy
```

```{r}
t1 <- tips_test_tidy$statistic
t1
```

Commentary: Although `cor.test` accepts the "tilde" notation, the order doesn't matter; correlation is symmetric, so the R value is the same independent of the choice of response and explanatory variables.

The output of the `cor.test` function is very similar to other hypothesis tests in R. The correlation coefficient is the `estimate`. Everything else is straightforward: the t score (`statistic`), P-value (`p.value`), degrees of freedom (`parameter`), and confidence interval (`conf.low` and `conf.high`).

You may have noticed that this is an insanely large t score. This is typical of correlation tests. If there is enough visual evidence of a correlation in the scatterplot, the R value will be pretty far from 0. That's why the full rubric for inference is somewhat overkill for questions about correlation.

### Report the test statistic in context (when possible).

The t score is `r t1`. The sample correlation between restaurant bills and tips is more than 14 standard errors away from the null value of zero.

### Plot the null distribution.

```{r}
pdist("t", df = tips_test_tidy$parameter,
      q = c(-t1, t1),
      invisible = TRUE)
```

### Calculate the P-value.

```{r}
P1 <- tips_test_tidy$p.value
P1
```

### Interpret the P-value as a probability given the null.

$P < 0.001$. If there were truly no correlation between tips and the total bill, there would be less than a 0.1% chance of seeing results at least as extreme as we saw in the data.

Commentary: $P < 0.001$ is quite the understatement. The P-value has 33 zeros after the decimal point! In fact, notice in the interpretation of the P-value, we don't even use inline R code because R would try to round it down to zero. Observe: `r 100 * P1`%. See? And we never want to say that the P-value is zero because it literally cannot be zero, even though it's very close.


## Conclusion

### State the statistical conclusion.

We reject the null hypothesis.

### State (but do not overstate) a contextually meaningful conclusion.

There is sufficient evidence that there is a correlation between the tip and the total bill (for this waiter at this restaurant).

### Identify the possibility of either a Type I or Type II error and state what making such an error means in the context of the hypotheses.

If we've made a Type I error, then there is actually no correlation between tips and the total bill, but this data shows one.


## Confidence interval

### Check the relevant conditions to ensure that model assumptions are met.

All the conditions have already been checked.

### Calculate the confidence interval.

```{r}
tips_test_tidy$conf.low
```

```{r}
tips_test_tidy$conf.high
```

### State (but do not overstate) a contextually meaningful interpretation.

We are 95% confident that the true correlation between tips and the total bill (for this waiter at this restaurant) is captured in the interval (`r tips_test_tidy$conf.low`, `r tips_test_tidy$conf.high`).

### If running a two-sided test, explain how the confidence interval reinforces the conclusion of the hypothesis test.

Since zero is not contained in the confidence interval, zero is not a plausible value for the correlation between tips and the total bill.

## Your turn

The `state` data from the `OIdata` package has a number of variables collected from various sources. There are 51 rows, representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Run a correlation test to determine if the percentage of the state's population that smokes is correlated with the median household income in each state.

There is something unusual about this example that you will need to consider in your answer. The sample is 50 states and the District of Columbia. The population is tricky though because these states don't represent some larger groups of states; we already have all the states in our data. One can think of this data, though, as a snapshot of what was true in each state at one point in time. Therefore, the population can be thought of as similar measurements taken at other times.

This also makes it difficult to check conditions. We do not have a random sample of states (as we have all of them), but remember that we're thinking of this as a sample across a number of years in which we might have gathered this data. Having said that, I imagine that median income goes up every year with inflation, so it may or may not be representative of other years. The 10% condition also requires some thought.

The rubric outline is reproduced below. You may refer to the worked example above and modify it accordingly. Remember to strip out all the commentary. That is just exposition for your benefit in understanding the steps, but is not meant to form part of the formal inference process.

Another word of warning: the copy/paste process is not a substitute for your brain. You will often need to modify more than just the names of the data frames and variables to adapt the worked examples to your own work. Do not blindly copy and paste code without understanding what it does. And you should **never** copy and paste text. All the sentences and paragraphs you write are expressions of your own analysis. They must reflect your own understanding of the inferential process.

**Also, so that your answers here don't mess up the code chunks above, use new variable names everywhere.**
